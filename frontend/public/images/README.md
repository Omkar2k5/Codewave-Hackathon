# Required Images for Landing Page

Please add the following images to this directory for the landing page to work properly:

## Problem Statement Slides
- `kumbh-mela.jpg` - Image showing the massive scale of Kumbh Mela or similar large gathering
- `stampede-incident.jpg` - Historical image of crowd incidents (use respectfully)
- `crowd-monitoring.jpg` - Image showing traditional crowd monitoring methods
- `ai-solution.jpg` - Image representing AI/technology solution

## Recommended Image Specifications
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading
- Content: High-quality, relevant to the slide content

## Alternative Approach
If you don't have specific images, you can:
1. Use stock photos from Unsplash, Pexels, or similar free sources
2. Replace the `image` property with `icon` in the slides array
3. Use the existing icon-based slides (which are already implemented)

## Current Implementation
The slides currently fall back to icon-based display when images are not available.
